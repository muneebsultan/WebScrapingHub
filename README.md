# Beautiful Soup Web Scraping

This branch demonstrates web scraping techniques using Beautiful Soup, a powerful Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. Hereâ€™s what I've implemented in this branch:

- Scraping specific HTML tags, including titles and meta descriptions
- Extracting all heading tags (h1-h6), along with titles and meta descriptions
- Extracting ALT attributes (image alternative text)
- Counting words on a web page
- Extracting all unique URLs from a website
